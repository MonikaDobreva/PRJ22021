## Project Charter << PRJ2 G3 >>

**1	Introduction / Management Summary**<br>
This project charter is about the Project 2 from the software engineering course at Fontys Venlo.

•	Purpose: 
The charter describes on a high level the purpose of the project 2 and what has to happen to reach an end delivery. Furthermore, it will illustrate the goal (section 2) and break down the work structures through the running time of the project (section 3). In section 4 the choice of solution is discussed, and the quality criteria are formulated in section 5. Based on these the time and effort is derived and estimated. An outline of the business case is given in section 7 followed by the risk this project underlies. In the last section is the organization listed.
By this setup the Project Charter describes a first full iteration around the “project square” from scope (S), through quality (Q) along time & effort (T) into budget (B). The items Risks (R) and Organization (O) complete the project description in this Project Charter.

•	Advice:  
Based on the analysis carried for this Project Charter proposal is to go ahead with the project.

The Business and IT costs for <<PRJ G3>> are xxxx, compared to an expected benefit of xxxx.


**2	Goal of the project (S,Q,T,B)**<br>
The program goals is to develop a functional airline booking system so that the airline company can boost their income by offering fast and reliable system to book tickets over the sales employees. By having a universal booking system no overlaps will occur anymore and all customers will have a very pleasant experience with flying with this airline. For all  employees the system is ready and easy to use system so there is no need for long introductions to use it.
The scope of this project is to design and implement a fully functional booking system that can be used by the airline sales employees to book tickets for the customer. It will handle multiple users and booking executions at once, have   manager dashboard to look at the most important kpi and show available flights. It also wil dynamically adapt to price changes that can be inserted by the sales officer not the program.
The quality of this program comes with one high priority which is user-friendliness. The employees should be able to quickly understand the system and start using it. Some graphics are also included.
The initial estimate of effort and time of this project will be around 21 weeks with 5 people working on it.

**3. Project Scope(S)<br>**

**3.1 Project definition<br>**
The project needs to achieve giving sales employees the opportunity of managing their customers’ demands and requirements regarding the booking of flights under predefined conditions <br>

**3.2 Project scope and exclusions<br>**
On high level the following aspects of “enterprise architecture” will be impacted by the << PRJ2 G3 >> project: <br>

|Architecture aspect|Involved entities|
|---|---|
|Organization||
|Process||
|Information||
|System||
|Infrastructure||

Core of the project is an application, that should be used by an airline company to manage all flights, bookings and connections in one place. The uses should be able to create, edit and delete flight, as well as manage and handle bookings from customers. A management dashboard should provide the opportunity to oversee certain key performance indicators, that inform the sales manager about relevant business analytics.<br>

**Not in Scope:**<br>
Due to the lack of high-end programming and software skills the functionalities of the applications are fairly limited and defined. It is not meant to deal with any other additional and unrelated topics that are not mentioned in the case study or project description. This means the final application is not used to handle payment and other transaction processes, as well as an access for the actual customer the flight is being booked for. <br>

**3.3 Relations & interfaces**<br>

**3.4	Products and Services to be delivered** <br>
The flow of products created during the project startup and initiation phase:<br>

**4. Approach** <br>
Various artifacts are made use of in order to analyse the project environment making it easier and more structured to continue with the implementation of the actual application. Since all these artifacts are seen as deliverables which must be prepared by the whole group and completed by a set day, an effective time and task management is essential for the future outcomes of the work. Furthermore, a case study gives a rough outline of a real-word context in which the project should be designed in and mentions additional constraints the team needs to consider. <br>

Ensuring the needed deliverables are handed in every week while continuously updating former artifacts makes the project more likely to be successful. Since help from outside is available questions and unclear situation can be handled fast enough without endangering the work process.<br>
Prior projects made clear how important it is to make sure that every member of the project team is familiar with the content and context of the tasks and prepared for upcoming tasks. Problems of comprehensions must be tackled as soon as possible to avoid any disturbance inside of the workflow.<br>
Weekly discussions about different possible methods and techniques as well as docent’s feedback and result evaluations in a collective class lecture are guaranteeing an optimized tactic for the project.<br>
External knowledge and resources, as long as project-related, can enhance the planning and problem-solving process in the group, although through prior lectures acquired skills should be enough to work with.<br>


**5. Quality (Q)**

**5.1 Customer quality expectations**
Customer expects:
-easily usable methods
-a system that is complex, but still easy to understand
-flight can be registered easily
-tickets can be booked easily
-flawless methods, that work without any errors

**5.2 Acceptance criteria**
-all methods must be complete and fully functional, all applicable cases considered

**5.3 Prerequisites & Constraints**
-A working flight registration must be implemented
-A way to book tickets including all ticket options must be implemented
-A management dashboard, showing multiple key performance indicators must be implemented

**6. Time and effort (T)**
|High level project phase|Lead time (start-end)|Business effort (days)|IT effort(days)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Start up and Initiation| 4 total weeks | 6 | 2 |
|Design, Realization and Confirmation| 3 total weeks | 2 | 2 |
|Deployment and go live| 8 total weeks | 4 | 12 |

**7.	Outline Business Case (B)**

**7.1	Alignment with corporate strategy**

As quoted above the main business drivers for PRJ2 G3 are:
-	Reduce complexity of the flight ticket sale process
-	Increase efficiency of the flight ticket sale process

**Benefits**
- Savings related to process step efficiency
- Savings on data entry and paper procedures
-	Enabling new process steps that can make the process easier
-	Disabling usual process steps that make the process more complicated
-	Limiting the amount of people involved with the process
 
**Costs**

The costs are grouped in these categories: 
- Analysis costs
- Design costs
- Implementation costs
- Realization costs
- Support costs
